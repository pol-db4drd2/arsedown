 abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter. }

	political control of the bureaucracy, in part by predisposing agencies
	toward policy choices preferred by legislators' favored constituents.
	Although this "deck-stacking" argument has been both influential
	and controversial, few scholars have subjected it to empirical examination.
	This article assesses the operation of a prominent administrative
	procedure-the notice and comment process-in the context of Medicare
	physician payment reform, a fundamental restructuring of the way
	in which the Medicare program pays for physician services. I find,
	contrary to the deck-stacking thesis, that the Health Care Financing
	Administration (HCFA) was more responsive to physicians expecting
	reductions in fees than to the intended beneficiaries of the new
	payment system. Although these results do not necessarily imply that
	Congress exerted little influence over HCFA decision making, they
	suggest that certain administrative procedures do not operate as
	instruments of political control.},

	Controversy stems from their pivotal role in overseeing policy implementation

	model to analyze the influence of these committees on policy outcomes.
	Our analysis provides three important insights. First, we show that,
	contrary to the conventional wisdom, comitology committees move outcomes
	toward the Commission's preferred policies rather than the Council's.
	Second, we demonstrate that the possibility of a Council veto may
	also move outcomes away from Council members' policy preferences
	and toward the Commission's. Third, the 1999 changes to the comitology
	procedures, designed to enhance the Commission's autonomy in policymaking,
	may have had the exact opposite effect. Paradoxically, we conclude
	that comitology serves to enhance the Commission's role in policy

	Although decisions about oversight and statutory control are separate,
	they are not independent. Plans to engage in ex post oversight make
	the benefits of statutory control less compelling and vice versa.
	In this sense, statutory control and oversight can be viewed as "substitutes"
	in the "production" of a controlled bureaucracy. From a legislator's
	point of view, the benefits of the two strategies depend on the policy
	area, the political environment, and the legislator's position within
	Congress. These exogenous factors determine a legislator's ideal
	level of each control strategy. Considering the two types of control
	in a single model leads to the finding that legislators who are members
	of the committee with jurisdiction over the agency prefer a lower
	level of statutory control than nonmembers. The difference occurs
	because the costs of oversight are lower for committee members. This
	prediction is tested using data from two bills that delegated policy

	promote political control provide little new technical information

  abstract = {Although a large literature on delegation exists, few models have
	pushed beyond a core set of canonical assumptions. This approach
	may be justified on grounds of tractability, but the failure to grasp
	the significance of different assumptions and push beyond specific
	models has limited our understanding of the incentives for delegation.
	Consequently, the justifications for delegation that have received
	recent scrutiny and testing differ from some of the more plausible
	justifications offered by informal studies of delegation. We show
	that surprisingly few results in the literature hinge on risk aversion,
	and surprisingly many turn on the ignored, though equally canonical,
	technological assumption that uncertainty is fixed (relative to policies).
	Relaxing the key assumptions about dimensionality and functional
	forms provides a clearer intuition about delegation -- one that is
	closer to classical treatments. The theory allows us to relate different
	institutional features (commitment, specialization costs, monitoring,
	multiple principals) to delegation's observable properties.},

	those between a committee and the floor of a legislature. Such relations,
	however, are always embedded in a larger context, namely, a political
	environment composed of voters and interest groups. In this paper
	we model agenda setters (a legislative committee) as decision makers
	with limited cognitive abilities who adjust over time to their larger
	political environment. The legislators' policy positions are endogenous,
	reflecting the relative strengths of voters wielding the district-specific
	resource of votes and of interest groups wielding the transferable
	resource of money. The resulting outcomes indicate that neoclassical
	models of voting and pluralist models of group influence have each
	told part of the story. When only votes matter, our boundedly rational
	agents grope toward equilibria close to those of neoclassical models;
	however, when mobile resources matter as well, the outcomes depart
	systematically from those of previous models. In particular, interest
	groups can make themselves worse off by capturing the committee.
	The results suggest that agenda control is less powerful than conventionally
	believed and point toward conditions shaping its effectiveness--conditions
	highlighting the distinctive contributions of pluralist and neoclassical
	thinking to a broader theory of political institutions.},

Instead, if the number of clusters is large, statistical inference after OLS should be based on cluster-robust standard errors.

  abstract = {Theory: A principal-agent model is used to assess if police department
	practices regarding the handling of domestic violence calls are responsive
	to direct orders which mandate arrest of abusers. We also examine
	the competing and complementary effects of bureaucratic discretion
	on responsiveness to direct orders. Hypotheses: State and city laws
	mandating the arrest of perpetrators of domestic violence will positively
	influence municipal police departments' reported reliance on arrest
	as the usual disposition of domestic violence calls. It is expected,
	however, that city laws, with their more proximate locus of influence,
	will have a greater impact on police response than will state laws.
	Methods: Probit and ordered probit analysis of data collected from
	1989 regarding the usual police response to domestic violence in
	three scenarios. Data were collected through mailed survey of a national
	sample of municipal police departments; national and state-level
	crime reports; directories of various service organizations; and
	census data. Results: Direct orders in the form of state and local
	laws requiring arrest of the perpetrators of domestic violence appear
	to be effective controls over police practice, but there is also
	evidence of bureaucratic discretion coexisting with political control.
	Further, both political control and bureaucratic discretion in this
	arena prove to be highly context-dependent.},

	Cook argues that a proper model requires recognition of the multiple

	of the normative foundations of principal-agent theory. Wood responds
	to both the substantive and methodological issues raised and suggests
	an eclectic approach in future research.},

	regulations. The model predicts that during times of divided control
	Congress delegates less discretionary authority to the executive
	branch, and that these changes in authority have significant policy
	consequences. We then test the implications of our model with data
	drawn from U.S. trade policy between 1890 and 1990. Our central finding

	the procedures that Congress designs to control the bureaucracy.},

	This "discretionary floor" rises as future events become more uncertain.
	We further show that the possibility of coalitional drift, or changing

  abstract = {In the past 15 years a scholarly debate has developed in the United
	States over the question "Who controls the bureaucracy?" Some have
	argued that Congress has a dominant influence on the bureaucracy,
	some that the president plays the major role in managing the bureaucracy,
	and others have emphasized the role of legal constraints on the bureaucracy,
	as enforced by the courts. Still others have asserted that the bureaucracy
	has a substantial amount of autonomy from the president, Congress,
	and courts. This article presents a formal model of multi-institutional
	policy-making that illuminates several key aspects of this debate.
	The model shows that there are conditions under which an agency will
	have considerable autonomy and conditions under which it will have
	virtually none. The model also shows that when an agency lacks autonomy,
	control of the agency usually cannot be attributed to just one institution.
	Finally, the model has some important implications for empirical
	tests of hypotheses about who controls the bureaucracy; among them
	is the fact that the empirical literature on control of the bureaucracy
	is based on a logic that gives a seriously incomplete picture of
	how the bureaucracy is controlled and who controls it.},

	two features that are novel in a multiagent setting: free riding
	and competition. The free-rider problem implies a new role for the
	principal: administering incentive schemes that do not balance the
	budget. This new role is essential for controlling incentives and
	suggests that firms in which ownership and labor are partly separated
	will have an advantage over partnerships in which output is distributed
	among agents. A new characterization of informative (hence valuable)
	monitoring is derived and applied to analyze the value of relative
	performance evaluation. It is shown that competition among agents
	(due to relative evaluations) has merit solely as a device to extract
	information optimally. Competition per se is worthless. The role
	of aggregate measures in relative performance evaluation is also
	explored, and the implications for investment rules are discussed.},

	capacity diminishes incentives for bureaucrats to comply with legislation,
	making it more difficult for politicians to induce bureaucrats to
	take actions that politicians desire. Consequently, when bureaucratic
	capacity is low, standard principles in the theoretical literature
	on delegation no longer hold. We also use the model to examine the
	issue of political reform in polities with low bureaucratic capacity.
	The model indicates that politicians in such polities will be trapped
	in a situation whereby they have little incentive to undertake reforms
	of either the bureaucracy or other institutions (such as courts)
	that are crucial for successful policymaking.},

	on checks and balances and the delegation of authority to independent
	agencies as institutional solutions to this problem. The political
	conditions under which these institutions enhance credibility, rather
	than policy stability, are still unclear, however. We show that checks-multiple
	veto players-enhance credibility, depending on the extent of uncertainty
	about the location of the status quo, on how agenda control is allocated
	among the veto players, and on whether veto players have delegated
	policymaking authority to independent agencies. In the context of
	monetary policy and independent central banks, we find evidence supporting
	the following predictions: Delegation is more likely to enhance credibility
	and political replacements of central bank governors are less likely
	in the presence of multiple political veto players; this effect increases
	with the polarization of veto players.},

	of the causal structure of regulatory performance--one that simultaneously
	allows for presidents, congressional committees, the courts, agency
	staff, constituents, and economic conditions. The empirical results
	are instructive. All of these factors prove to have significant impacts
	on NLRB decisions. In addition, the core regulatory actors--Board
	members, staff, and constituents--are shown to engage in mutually
	adaptive adjustment: each is responsive to the decisions of each
	of the others, and their reciprocal relationships impart equilibrating
	properties to the system as a whole. Thus, the evidence points to
	a varied set of important determinants and to the dynamic nature
	of their interconnection. To the extent that these findings are at
	all characteristic of other regulatory agencies, simple popular models
	of regulation are likely to give anemic explanations, if not highly
	distorted accounts, of why agencies behave as they do.},

  abstract = {Government can facilitate cooperation between private parties in collective
	action dilemmas. Regulatory agencies provide a bargaining arena to
	establish common expectations, and enforcement activities aid in
	monitoring cooperative agreements. We compare two enforcement models
	of the impact of OSHA inspections on workplace safety. The deterrence
	model assumes that enforcement rests on coercion, so only inspections
	imposing sanctions should reduce injuries in inspected plants. The
	collective action model assumes that enforcement can also facilitate
	cooperation by providing information, so complaint inspections that
	signal worker mistrust can decrease injuries even without sanctions.
	We test the impact of OSHA inspections on injury rates at 6,842 plants
	during 1979-85, using maximum likelihood regression analysis to analyze
	the panel data. Inspections initiated by workers reduce injuries
	regardless of penalty, suggesting that information rather than coercion
	is the critical factor in complaint inspections. Regular inspections
	reduce injuries only when penalties are imposed, which is consistent
	with both models. We conclude that both coercive and facilitative
	models are needed to understand regulatory behavior.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in some of the
	literature on political control of the administrative agencies, away
	from an emphasis on agency autonomy and toward the view that politicians
	can and do exert significant amounts of control over agency decisions.
	This shift has been particularly evident in the mainstream political
	science journals and includes both theoretical and empirical work.
	I argue here that this shift in thinking may be premature, and that
	these recent works do not really challenge our understanding of why
	widespread agency autonomy is an inherent byproduct of the delegation
	of policy-making authority from politicians to agencies. Much of
	the new theory of political control comes from positive theorists,
	who emphasize the ability of politicians to shape agencies' decision-making
	environments in ways that steer agencies' subsequent decisions toward
	the politicians' policy goals. Much of the new empirical work comes
	from quantitative empiricists whose statistical models of agency
	behavior find significant amounts of agency responsiveness to external
	political stimuli. Neither of these groups, however, demonstrate
	that politicians can overcome the delegation problem; rather, they
	model the problem away. Positive theorists do this by assuming away
	the importance of substantive policy foresight to politicians' efforts
	to influence subsequent agency decisions. Quantitative empiricists
	do this by choosing as their dependent variable agency implementation
	of established policies, rather than agency policy making itself.
	While both are driven to this result by their own separate methodological
	imperatives (and a commendable preference for scientific rigor),
	the result is the same. Neither group of models is sufficiently rich
	or generalizable to challenge the notion that agencies act with a
	great deal of autonomy when exercising most delegated policy-making
	authority.},

	The adoption of the Pendleton Act of 1883 has been cited as another
	in a long line of examples in which members have "stacked the deck"
	in their own self-interests (Johnson and Libecap 1994a). I challenge
	these pervasive views by presenting evidence that public pressure
	was an important and frequently overlooked factor in explaining the
	adoption of civil service reform in the late nineteenth century.
	More generally, I argue that members of Congress will enact reforms
	that diminish their power or restrict their authority only when the
	public is attentive and united; otherwise, they will establish governing
	structures and rules that facilitate their own reelections. This
	insight sheds light, more broadly, on the relationship between the

	legislators who attempt to limit executive agency discretion under

	quo policies and levels of discretion, various agency preferences,
	and the possibility of an executive veto, in order to determine the
	level of bureaucratic discretion chosen in a separation of powers
	system. Three main findings emerge: (1) given certain status quo
	conditions and preference arrangements, discretion can be increased
	or decreased under either divided or unified government; (2) executive
	agencies are more likely to receive discretion under unified government,
	but independent agencies are more likely to receive discretion under
	divided government; and (3) there exists an asymmetry between politicians'
	ability to expand bureaucratic discretion and their ability to restrict
	discretion.},

	Offices changed the ability of national political superiors to intervene
	in policy implementation in the field. Examining Regional Office
	data on the enforcement of reactor regulations from 1975 to 1996,
	I present statistical tests of the changing influence of national
	political institutions, local policy preferences, and the Regions’
	task environment. I find that decentralization insulated the NRC
	from national political oversight, and that the Regions were more
	responsive to local oversight postdevolution and deviated from a
	‘natural rate’ of enforcement.},

  abstract = {A principal-agent perspective has been employed in recent studies
	to rediscover the importance of democratic hierarchies in shaping
	public bureaucratic outputs. I test the robustness of the hierarchy
	model for explaining outputs from an agency that has often been cast
	in the image of bureaucratic independence, the Environmental Protection
	Agency. Examining the effect of the Reagan presidency on EPA outputs
	for clean air, Box-Tiao models are constructed to explain shifts
	in the vigor of air pollution enforcements between 1977 and 1985.
	The analysis shows that the influence of elected institutions is
	limited when an agency has substantial bureaucratic resources and
	a zeal for their use. Moreover, under these conditions, bureaucracy
	can even move outputs in directions completely opposite from what
	a model of hiearchy would predict. The implication is that for some
	agencies it is necessary to give greater consideration to the agent
	in explaining implementation outcomes through time.},

	as the congressional dominance hypothesis. This line of theorizing
	suggests that we should not expect to find evidence of substantial

	here reexamines the theoretical underpinnings of the congressional
	dominance hypothesis and concludes that the original theoretical
	formulation in fact anticipated a significant degree of regulatory
	discretion. The modified hypothesis is evaluated by examining a particularly
	apt case, a protracted controversy over so-called nonbank banks.},
